Miscellaneous: This Agreement (which hereby incorporates by reference any other provisions applicable to use of the Services , including, but not limited to, any supplemental terms governing the use of certain specific material contained on the Website and any operating rules for the Services established by TBESportsGaming) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable, and the unenforceability of any one or more provisions will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions. In addition, if any provision of the Agreement, for any reason, is declared to be unenforceable, the parties will substitute an enforceable provision that, to the maximum extent possible under applicable law, preserves the original intentions and economic positions of the parties. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Notwithstanding this, you agree that TBESportsGaming may still apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.  The failure by TBESportsGaming to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of any breach of this Agreement by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by us or be deemed a waiver by TBESportsGaming of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of this Agreement.  TBESportsGaming’s rights and remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit TBESportsGaming’s right to exercise any other right or remedy.
